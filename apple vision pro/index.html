                        Testing conducted by Apple in May 2023 using preproduction Apple Vision Pro units and software.
                        Testing consisted of full battery discharge while performing each of the following tasks: video
                        playback, internet browsing, spatial video capture, and FaceTime. Video playback tested in
                        conjunction with an Environment, using 2D movie content purchased from the Apple TV app.
                        Internet browsing tested using 20 popular websites. FaceTime tested between two Apple Vision Pro
                        units with Personas enabled. Tested with Wi-Fi associated to a network. Battery life depends on
                        device settings, usage, network, environmental conditions, and many other factors. Battery tests
                        are conducted using specific Apple Vision Pro units; actual results may vary.<br><br>
